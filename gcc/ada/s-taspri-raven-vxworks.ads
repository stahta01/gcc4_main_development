   type Task_Body_Access is access procedure;
   --  Pointer to the task body's entry point (or possibly a wrapper
   --  declared local to the GNARL).

   type Private_Data is limited private;
   --  Any information that the GNULLI needs maintained on a per-task
   --  basis.  A component of this type is guaranteed to be included
   --  in the Ada_Task_Control_Block.

   subtype Task_Address is System.Address;
   --  In some versions of Task_Primitives, notably for VMS, Task_Address is
   --  the short version of address defined in System.Aux_DEC. To avoid
   --  dragging Aux_DEC into tasking packages a tasking specific subtype is
   --  defined here.
